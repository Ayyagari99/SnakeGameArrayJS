# Snake Game in JS
This is the javascript version of the classic Snake Game in which the snake has to eat tasty watermelons to gain points!  <br />
The snake must not touch the outline of the screen, on doing so, the game ends.<br />
Load the page to play again. <br />
This is an infinite game, so play till you can! 

# In Action:
These is the main page:

When the snake/array hits the outline of the page, the game ends:

Would like to thank Prateek bhaiya, Arnav bhaiya and all the resources on Youtube and Stack Overflow always! :)

# A Small Catch:
The game does not end when the snake hits itself. <br />
This part is yet to be developed. <br />

# Snake Game in JS
This is the javascript version of the classic Snake Game in which the snake has to eat tasty watermelons to gain points!<\br> 
The snake must not touch the outline of the screen, on doing so, the game ends. <\br>
This is an infinite game, so play till you can!

# In Action:
These is the main page:

When the snake/array hits the outline of the page, the game ends:
